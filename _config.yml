  Hi, my name's Jungki Son and 
  I am interested in using deep learning to change the world. I have an interest in deep learning models based on convolutional layers, transformer-based natural language processing models, and generative models. I am expanding my understanding through personal projects little by little.

          - Paper Translator is a code that translates academic papers using mathpix and chatGPT APIs. It was developed to address various issues such as a significant drop in translation quality and reduced readability of equations that occur when academic papers are fully translated through services like DeepL or Google Translator.
          - When fully translating a paper, a major factor that reduces readability is the improper OCR recognition of images and equations, leading to issues when recreating the document post-translation. Mathpix excels in the OCR process by accurately recognizing images and equations, and converting them into high-quality Latex or Markdown. Additionally, when an article contains equations, the fundamental idea of this code is to use GPT-4, which translates the article more effectively if it includes equations represented in Latex, rather than just the text converted from equations.

          - The Sauturi Lab is a group dedicated to researching and writing papers on a multi NMT (Neural Machine Translation) model that translates English into five regional dialects in Korea (Chungcheong, Jeju, Gangwon, Gyeongsang, Jeolla).
          - This group explores one-to-many translation methods related to Low-Resource Languages (LRL) and conducts experiments based on hypotheses.
          - The project has social value as it can contribute to language preservation in Korea, and it provides an opportunity to contribute to the necessity and advancement of Korean LRL research.

          - This project is part of the Deep Learning education program offered by [ModuLabs](https://modulabs.co.kr/)(https://modulabs.co.kr/). There is active research on 6D Pose Estimation models to expedite the installation process of robots used in the industrial field. The project aims to explore methods for simplifying the use and training of Deep Learning models, specifically the 6D Pose Estimation model, which enables computers to directly perceive the position and orientation of objects.
          - The FFB6D model, which is one of the 6D Pose Estimation models, has been modified based on it, and the modifications have been made to make it applicable with other Depth Cameras, as long as the Camera Parameters are provided, instead of the Depth Camera used by the original model.
          - I was responsible for modifying the model's code and conducting model training as part of the project.

          - This educational program is part of [Modulabs](https://modulabs.co.kr)' Deep Learning curriculum. It covers a broad range of topics in machine learning and data science, with a focus on computer vision deep learning and natural language processing deep learning using CNN and RNN as foundational concepts. Additionally, I learned the fundamentals of generative models through DCGAN and pursued advanced studies in the fields of computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP).
          - Personally, I chose CV and learned various backbone models used in CV tasks such as ResNet. I also studied OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and YOLO. With the assistance of other colleagues, I then delved into the NLP course, learning about transformer models and the Hugging Face library used for handling such models.

      - I always enjoy learning new things, but at the same time, I appreciate the beauty of the old. I aspire to find a path where AI can lead modern society in a positive direction, drawing upon my knowledge of humanities.

      - I have been active in 'Our Neighborhood Youth Association', which is based in Mangwon-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul, for the past 10 years. 'Our Neighborhood Youth Association' has been engaged in community-based volunteer activities and operated a youth alternative space called 'Beyond Imagination' near Hongik University, a cultural landmark in Seoul. I also served as the president of 'Our Neighborhood Youth Association' for two years.[[link](https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/047/0002078167?sid=103)]

      - I also appreciate the mathematical depth and ever-changing nature of baseball as a sport.
